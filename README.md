# README

This repository contains code for classifying publicly available H5N1 sequences by host category. All data was accessed from public databases, primarily the [Influenza Research Database](https://www.fludb.org/brc/home.spg?decorator=influenza) and [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/). GISAID does not permit republishing data acquired from them, so any data present in this repository represents sequence data that available from the Influenza Research Database, which pulls from Genbank. 

Host classification was done manually by me. This code is open and available for others to use. However, I ask that if you plan to use this code or curated data for publication, to please get in contact with me first at lhmoncla@gmail.com. Thank you!
