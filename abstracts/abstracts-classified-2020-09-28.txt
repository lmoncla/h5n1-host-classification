12021367	domestic	used a duck isolate from domestic duck meat that had been imported from China to South Korea. They then did lab experiments where they infected chickens
20016038	domestic	isolated these from either decoy ducks (H5N3s) or from free-range commercial ducks
22710372	domestic	surveillance of poultry in Laos
29104094	domestic	surveillance of poultry during outbreaks in Nigeria
16845780	domestic	poultry that died during a small outbreak in a village in Siberia
25938456	exclude	this was a study where they took a couple isolates that have different pathogenicities in mice, and passaged and studied them
28036106	domestic	these are samples from domestic peahens and peacocks from a palace in Kirkuk city in Iraq
19074791	domestic	isolated from outbreaks among poultry in Myanmar
27162026	domestic	this paper describes peacocks and tigers that died from H5N1 in a zoo in China
15859328	exclude	they use an F3 virus from a goose and clone it into a murine leukemia virus vector to study stuff
16183140	domestic	this is actually a methods paper where they develop an RT-PCR method and then to show it works, test it on poultry and mammal samples
16713612	domestic	poultry isolates from Indonesia and Vietnam
21466927	wild	this is an isolate from a wild mallard duck infected with H5N1 that was apparently healthy
23402103	domestic	poultry in Egypt; this abstract/paper might have some information about small vs. large farms
18984006		you unfortunately cannot tell from the paper whether these duck samples were domestic or wild. I'd guess domestic because the person who provided them was from the vet school, but we can't be sure 
23683998	domestic	chickens and ducks sampled during an outbreak in Vietnam; samples came from dead birds
22377052	see strain list	this project looked at both domestic and wild birds. I am pretty positive that all of the species in the wild list are ones I have classified as wild, but they also provide a table which I will use to manually add those in
15964604	domestic	this paper is an analysis of H5N1 infected duck meat from Japan imported from China. They isolate it and infect birds and mice as well to characterize pathogenicity
18712589	domestic	characterizing H5N1 in poultry in Israel
22371029	domestic	characterization of H5N1 in domestic ducks in China
16447511	wild	there were recurrent outbreaks among domestic ostriches and to investigate why they surveilled wild aquatic birds for several years in South Africa 
18394281	domestic	poultry surveillance in Vietnam
27389972		they classified both domestic and wild birds, and don't specify. I think there is actually only 1 duck sequence here
20836384	domestic	domestic duck from an H5N1 reassortant virus with internals from H9N2
17276709	exclude	I don't think that this paper is even about influenza, they may have just used it as a vector or something
18801394		this required reading the actual paper and making a bit of a guess, and in the end I'm not totally sure. In the paper, they sequence 19 new poultry and 11 wild. 9/11 wild are unambiguously storks/sparrows. 15/19 domestic are chickens. That leaves 2 ducks, 2 quails, and 2 pigeons 
21173241	exclude	this was a study where they did ancestral state reconstruction on an H5 HA tree and used that to make a vaccine target. They generate a replication-competent virus as well 
23458714		unclear, they characterize viruses from a variety of species
16532371	domestic	these viruses were isolated form shell washes of duck or goose eggs confiscated from people traveling from Vietnam
16473931	domestic	I had to read the actual paper for this, but the information is available in figure 1. In green and blue are the wild birds, which are all annotated as either migratory duck or migratory bird. For this figure, brown strains are the domestic poultry, and these are labelled simply as "duck". So, because I have annotated in my strain text file that "migratory duck" is a wild bird, I can annotate all remaining ambiguous duck sequences as domestic for this paper
18032512	exclude	they use existing duck sequences to generate some reassortant viruses and assess NS1 pathogenicity in mice 
17512143	domestic	they sequenced a virus from a smuggled duck 
21310090	wild	they sequenced a fecal sample collected from a wild, migratory mallard duck in Japan 
16318689	domestic	they characterize H5N1 viruses sampled from a 2004 outbreak in humans and poultry
24655395	domestic	active surveillance among domestic poultry in Egypt
11878904	domestic	looked at domestic ducks and geese imported for food into China
18172752	wild	these were European wild birds sampled during an outbreak
11739677	domestic	looking at pathogenic effects of viruses isolated from poultry in China
18216109	domestic	collected samples from live poultry markets in southern China
20335251	wild	looked at wild birds that died following an outbreak in Austria
24880916	domestic	there was a outbreak in a domestic duck farm in Vietnam that occurred just a few days after they had vaccinated the ducks; a bunch died and the infecting viruses were very different
18789611	domestic	they characterize sequences from a turkey farm outbreak in the Czech Republic
26627108	domestic	surveillance in live poultry markets in China
18387755		unclear, they sequenced 3 duck samples, 1 from each of 3 outbreaks. 2 were from domestic ducks, 1 was from a dead, wild duck 
16439620		this is pretty frustrating, they have this big repository of sequences from St. Jude and sequenced a bunch of birds, including domestic and wild birds. they don't specify anywhere which strains are which 
26748550	domestic	domestic duck farm samples from Vietnam that had recently been vaccinated
20016036	domestic	domestic poultry in Laos
18031958	wild	wild birds infected with H5N1 in Germany
25604926	domestic	isolated from live poultry markets in China
23921843	wild	they took an isolate from a bird in California, but this was mostly a study about the effects of passaging on sequencing
22212904		I read the paper and it is still unclear whether the duck and quail are domestic or wild
18675524	domestic	they have 3 isolates from poultry in Thailand and characterize pathogenicity in chickens, ducks, and quails
15241415	domestic	isolated from poultry in live markets, either sick or not
22843856	exclude	this is a parrot sequence, which I don't think is important for me to include or use 
17662125	exclude	they took a duck virus and infected mice 
19464724	domestic	poultry surveillance in Indonesia
17075062	domestic	the vast majority of samples in this paper come from live poultry market surveillance. there were an additional 16 samples that come from smuggled poultry + wild birds. I found all the sequences associated with this paper, and the wild bird strains were obvious. So I am quite confident that the remaining duck and geese are domestic
20432047		I'm pretty sure domestic, but I can't be sure. They sequence 4 strains from "wild and domestic birds"
15671756		I read this paper and it does not say whether the duck sequence was domestic or wild
18787938	wild	wild birds found dead during/after an outbreak in Switzerland
16007072	wild	this is from a cool looking nature paper identifying that migratory, bar-headed geese can carry h5n1
15717120	domestic	isolated from farms in China
22363750	domestic	poultry in India
24993865	domestic	farmed quails in China
15235128	domestic	domestic ducks from China, apparently healthy

18941631	domestic	surveillance in Vietnam
27309046	domestic	live bird market and backyard poultry surveillance in Bangladesh
26656683	domestic	from live bird markets in China
17522271	exclude	this paper is all about erthrocyte binding
22017055	exclude	they found a dead emu in a nature reserve in Israel. I guess this must be an escaped zoo animal or something, but I think we should just exclude it
20538856	domestic	in this paper, they specify that they sample domestic and wild birds, but specify that they sampled chickens, ducks, geese, and wild birds, implying that the chickens, ducks and geese are domestic
20071565	domestic	poultry in Nigeria
17459857	wild	collected dead, wild birds in Bavaria
17498292	domestic	this paper looked at domestic and wild birds. However, all of the wild birds are from species I have already classified as always wild. The domestic samples are 1 peacock, 1 fowl, and 2 muscovy ducks. These were all isolated from a hobby poultry farm
17694626	domestic	a large outbreak of H5N1 in a large commercial meat turkey site in England
21896207	domestic	specifically looked at H5N1 in smallholder duck farms in Indonesia
18774155		I'm pretty sure that this is describing domestic bird sequences from poultry in China; however, it is not explicitly stated
18976558	domestic	live bird markets and food markets in Thailand
19520524	domestic	this paper describes both domestic and wild samples; however, the wild samples are all mute swans, and the goose sample is from a free-range goose farm in Hungary
21749770	domestic	isolated from 2 apparently healthy domestic ducks in China
16935377	domestic	isolated H5N1 from poultry samples during an outbreak in Thailand
15681421	domestic	they characterized pathogenicity of isolates from a 2004 outbreak in Thailand among human and poultry
19058578	domestic	they sequenced NS genes from diseased or dead poultry during an outbreak in Thailand between 2004 and 2005
18202945	domestic	in this paper they report on domestic and wild birds; however, all of the wild birds have species names that I have classified as always wild; there is one sequence from a turkey that was isolated from a large outbreak on a turkey farm in France. So the turkey sequence is domestic
20521713	domestic	received samples from poultry outbreak investigation in Egypt
17553267	domestic	poultry from Russia
29574145	domestic	collected during poultry surveillance in Indonesia
21327896	domestic	ducks in Egypt that were "house-reared", which I assume means that they come from small, household farms
10074191	domestic	sequences from poultry farms in Hong Kong
27199961	domestic	the viruses were isolated from apparently healthy birds in live bird markets
27174088	domestic	poultry from India
19088292	domestic	poultry in Thailand; all but one were from backyard flocks; 1 was from a broiler chicken farm 
24722680	domestic	surveillance of poultry in Egypt
19428743		unclear; this is most likely domestic, as they are describing chicken and duck sequences from Vietnam, which I would assume are from surveillance. However, they don't explicitly say whether these samples came from domestic or wild birds
21977732	wild	there are 2 duck sequences associated with this paper. they were both isolated from feces from wild, migrating ducks in Japan
17728231	wild	apparently this is wild bird surveillance in the US, which is pretty cool 
22806090	domestic	these viruses were all sampled during poultry outbreaks in Myanmar
17553279	domestic	they collected viruses from wild hooded vultures, and also for comparison a domestic guinea fowl and a few backyard chickens; so the vultures are wild, the guinea fowl is domestic
22113008	wild	this describes samples collected during wild bird surveillance in Japan, which also caused an outbreak on a bunch of chicken farms. The duck samples in this paper are wild duck and the only domestic samples are chicken 
21904849	wild	wild swans in China
12077307	domestic	surveillance in poultry from retail markets and from imported duck and geese at central wholesale slaughter facilities
28770175	domestic	swabbed poultry in China
17626485	wild	these were isolated from migrating birds in China
19800184	domestic	all samples taken from poultry infected during 3 waves of outbreaks in South Korea
21632563		the title says that this paper is looking at wild ducks, but they say they collected samples from chickens and ducks during outbreaks, so I don't know how to label this. I am just going to leave as unknown
23776615	domestic	samples came from commercial farms and domestic settings in Indonesia
23650608		they were mostly interested in pH stability so they don't say where their isolates came from
18325269	domestic	they looked at domestic and wild samples from South Korea, but they only report 2 wild samples, and they are both labelled as environmental (feces). So the duck and quail are domestic
15731263		not clear, and I think this only refers to 1 duck sequence
23861018		I couldn't really tell from the paper which sequences were from domestic vs. wild birds
23226433	domestic	poultry in Vietnam
17616798	domestic	poultry in Israel
22515536	domestic	poultry in Vietnam
21586098	domestic	poultry in Vietnam that were visibly sick. this paper may have some information on farm size and vaccinated or not
19279171	domestic	this paper just uses a bunch of avian samples on hand to test out a new method. Conveniently, in table 1, they list all the samples positive for H5N1 and whether they were domestic. All of the avian samples that were not from obviously wild birds are domestic (poultry, chicken, duck, goose). There is 1 goose that is wild, but it was H7N7 so it should not be in this dataset
19937535	domestic	they isolated viruses from apparently healthy and dead domestic mallard ducks in China
18631423	domestic	samples taken from outbreaks in Nigeria
15148370	see strain list	this paper looks at both domestic and wild birds, and the strain names themselves do not always match the exact species (for example, "duck" can mean domestic duck or a wild duck). However, Table 1 breaks down where each virus was sampled, making it clear whether it is domestic or wild. I added these to the strain specific annotations file
27922116	domestic	household poultry sampled in Egypt
23804642	domestic	they performed active surveillance on duck farms that lie near migratory stopover sites in China, which is really cool 
22498319		unclear, they got a sample from a goose, but they don't say where it came from
19924254	domestic	sampled from poultry outbreaks in India
18931064	see strain list	this is a weird paper, because in addition to standard poultry, they also characterize H5N1 in imported falconry birds (a falcon and a houbara bustard). I have no idea what to do with these birds, so I might just end up excluding them, but they are indeed, domestic
21782862	wild	wild, migrating ducks in South Korea
19290041	domestic	from the wording in the methods it appears as though H5N1 was only really detected in the domestic samples, and that poultry isolates were used
23469251	exclude	this is a study about the pathogenicity of PB1-F2, and they use a duck sample that it is not clear where it came from 
21674170	domestic	poultry farms in Egypt
26038508	domestic	poultry markets in Bangladesh
10484749	domestic	this is the original A/goose/Guangdong/1996 paper; I have confirmed that this is from a domestic goose!
16704821	wild	a cat in Thailand ate a dead pigeon. they sampled from the cat and also sampled a dead pigeon in the area that the cat lived. the owner confirmed that the cat ate a dead pigeon
27369428	domestic	these were domestic pigeons that were naturally infected in Egypt. there are apparently open air areas where domestic pigeons are raised
19742325	wild	they did surveillance among wild birds in China
28116911	domestic	domestic pigeons were submitted by their owners for testing in Egypt. Apparently pigeons are sometimes used for racing
21251691	wild	wild pigeon from Thailand
18774155	exclude	this paper is totally legit, but the one hit I got in the data that wasn't classified was a turkey sequence from England that is matched with this paper on Genbank. The paper was all about viruses in China, so I think this sequence is misannotated
18216109	domestic	surveilled live poultry markets in China from 2001 to 2004
